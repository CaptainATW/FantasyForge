# Fantasyforge
Fantasy Forge is a text-based story game where you create a character and play as it, navigating through a fantastical world, and having control of your character's actions in the game. It uses gpt-3.5 turbo, and was coded with python. 

This project was created for Leland CS club hackathon.
